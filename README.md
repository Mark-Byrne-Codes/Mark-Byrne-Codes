### Hi there, I'm Mark Byrne

I'm a software developer with a background in client management and quality assurance, now focused on building robust and efficient applications.

I'm currently a student at **Hive Helsinki (42 Network)**, where I'm diving deep into systems programming with C and C++. I also have a strong passion for data-driven web applications, with experience in Python, Django, and Machine Learning.
